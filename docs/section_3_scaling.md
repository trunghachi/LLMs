# Section 3: Scaling Model Training

Training Large Language Models (LLMs) on massive datasets requires significant computational resources. This section covers techniques to scale training across multiple GPUs or nodes, focusing on distributed training and optimization strategies like ZeRO (Zero Redundancy Optimizer).

## Objectives
- Learn the basics of distributed training for LLMs.
- Understand how ZeRO optimizes memory usage in distributed setups.
- Prepare for Project 3, where you’ll implement distributed training.

## Distributed Training Basics
### 1. Why Scale?
- LLMs often have billions of parameters, requiring terabytes of memory.
- Single-GPU training is infeasible due to memory and time constraints.
- CPU vs. GPU vs. TPU.
- GPU architecture (e.g., NVIDIA A100).

### 2. Distributed Training Strategies
- **Data Parallelism**: Split the dataset across GPUs, replicate the model.
- **Model Parallelism**: Split the model across GPUs (e.g., layer-wise or tensor parallelism).
- **Pipeline Parallelism**: Divide the model into stages, process mini-batches in a pipeline.

### 3. ZeRO (Zero Redundancy Optimizer)
- **Purpose**: Reduces memory redundancy in data parallelism.
- **How It Works**:
  - Partitions optimizer states, gradients, and parameters across GPUs.
  - Stages (ZeRO-1 to ZeRO-3) offer increasing memory savings.
- **Benefit**: Enables training of larger models on limited hardware.

## Optimizations
- Mixed precision (FP16/BF16).
- Fault tolerance (checkpointing).
- Cost optimization (AWS spot instances).

## Practical Implementation
You’ll implement distributed training using PyTorch’s DistributedDataParallel (DDP) and ZeRO. The code is located in `src/section_3_scaling/`:
- `distributed.py`: Contains the distributed training setup.
  - **Code Placeholder**: Implement DDP with ZeRO optimization.
 
- Use Hugging Face Accelerate on AWS SageMaker.

### Project 3: Distributed Training with ZeRO
- **Goal**: Scale training of a Transformer model across multiple GPUs.
- **Steps**:
  1. Set up a multi-GPU environment.
  2. Implement DDP with ZeRO in `distributed.py`.
  3. Train a small Transformer model on a subset of Wikitext.
- **Details**: See [Project 3: Distributed Training with ZeRO](project_3_distributed.md).

Proceed to [Section 4: Fine-Tuning LLMs](section_4_finetuning.md) to explore efficient fine-tuning techniques.
