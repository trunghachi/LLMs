# Section 4: Fine-Tuning LLMs

Fine-tuning Large Language Models (LLMs) on specific tasks can be resource-intensive. This section explores parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods like LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) and QLoRA (Quantized LoRA), which reduce memory usage while maintaining performance.

## Objectives
- Understand the challenges of full fine-tuning.
- Learn how LoRA and QLoRA work for efficient fine-tuning.
- Prepare for Project 4, where you’ll fine-tune a model with QLoRA.

## Tasks
- Language modeling.
- Text classification.
- Sequence prediction.

## Fine-Tuning Challenges
- **Memory Usage**: Full fine-tuning updates all model parameters, requiring significant GPU memory.
- **Overfitting**: Small datasets can lead to overfitting, especially with large models.

## Techniques
- **Catastrophic Forgetting**: Mitigation strategies.
- **LoRA/QLoRA**: Parameter-efficient fine-tuning.
- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Learning rate schedules.

## Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT)
### 1. LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation)
- **Purpose**: Fine-tune only a small subset of parameters.
- **How It Works**:
  - Freezes the pretrained weights.
  - Adds low-rank updates to weight matrices (e.g., W = W_0 + ΔW, where ΔW = A * B).
- **Benefit**: Reduces memory footprint and speeds up training.

### 2. QLoRA (Quantized LoRA)
- **Purpose**: Further optimize LoRA by quantizing the model.
- **How It Works**:
  - Quantizes the pretrained model to 4-bit precision.
  - Applies LoRA updates on the quantized model.
- **Benefit**: Enables fine-tuning on consumer-grade GPUs.

## Practical Implementation
You’ll implement LoRA and QLoRA using the PEFT library. The code is located in `src/section_4_finetuning/`:
- `lora.py`: Implements LoRA fine-tuning.
  - **Code Placeholder**: Implement LoRA layers and training loop.
- `qlora.py`: Implements QLoRA fine-tuning.
  - **Code Placeholder**: Implement quantization and QLoRA training loop.

### Project 4: Fine-Tuning with QLoRA
- **Goal**: Fine-tune a pretrained LLM using QLoRA.
- **Steps**:
  1. Load a pretrained Transformer model.
  2. Apply quantization and LoRA in `qlora.py`.
  3. Fine-tune on a small dataset (e.g., Alpaca).
- **Details**: See [Project 4: Fine-Tuning with QLoRA](project_4_qlora.md).

## Next Steps
Proceed to [Section 5: Deploying LLMs](section_5_deployment.md) to learn about deployment strategies.
