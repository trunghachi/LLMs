# Section 5: Deploying LLMs

Deploying Large Language Models (LLMs) in production requires optimizing for latency, throughput, and security. This section covers scalable deployment strategies using tools like vLLM, which provides efficient inference for LLMs.

## Objectives
- Learn the challenges of deploying LLMs in production.
- Understand how vLLM optimizes inference.
- Prepare for Project 5, where you’ll deploy an LLM endpoint.

## Deployment Challenges
- **Latency and Throughput**: LLMs are computationally expensive, leading to high inference latency.
- **Memory Usage**: Large models require significant GPU memory.
- **Security**: Exposing LLMs via APIs risks misuse (e.g., generating harmful content).

## vLLM for Efficient Inference
- **Purpose**: Optimizes inference for LLMs with high throughput.
- **How It Works**:
  - Uses PagedAttention to reduce memory fragmentation.
  - Supports batching and continuous batching for better GPU utilization.
- **Benefit**: Enables deployment on smaller hardware with minimal latency.

## Practical Implementation
You’ll deploy an LLM using vLLM and expose it via an API. The code is located in `src/section_5_deployment/`:
- `deploy.py`: Contains the deployment script.
  - **Code Placeholder**: Implement vLLM inference and API setup with FastAPI.
- Cloud (AWS, GCP) vs. on-premises.

## Optimizations
- Continuous batching.
- KV-caching.
- Multi-LoRA.

## Monitoring
Prometheus/Grafana for latency and errors.

### Project 5: LLM Endpoint with vLLM
- **Goal**: Deploy a fine-tuned LLM as an API endpoint.
- **Steps**:
  1. Set up vLLM with a fine-tuned model.
  2. Create a FastAPI endpoint in `deploy.py`.
  3. Test the endpoint with sample queries.
- **Details**: See [Project 5: LLM Endpoint with vLLM](project_5_deployment.md).

## Next Steps
Proceed to [Section 6: Building the Application Layer](section_6_application.md) to develop RAG-based applications.
