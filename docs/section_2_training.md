# Section 2: Training LLMs to Follow Instructions

Training Large Language Models (LLMs) is a multi-stage process that involves pretraining on large corpora, fine-tuning on specific tasks, and aligning the model to follow human instructions. This section explores these stages, focusing on techniques like Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO).

## Objectives
- Understand the stages of LLM training: pretraining, fine-tuning, and alignment.
- Learn how RLHF and DPO align LLMs with human preferences.
- Prepare for Project 2, where you’ll implement alignment techniques.

## Stages of LLM Training
### 1. Pretraining
- **Goal**: Teach the model general language understanding using a large, diverse corpus.
- **How It Works**:
  - Train on datasets like Wikitext or Common Crawl.
  - Objective: Predict the next token (language modeling).
  - Use a large Transformer model with billions of parameters.
- **Challenges**:
  - Requires massive compute resources.
  - Data quality impacts model performance.

### 2. Fine-Tuning
- **Goal**: Adapt the pretrained model to specific tasks (e.g., question answering, dialogue).
- **How It Works**:
  - Use a smaller, task-specific dataset (e.g., Alpaca).
  - Objective: Minimize task-specific loss (e.g., cross-entropy for classification).
- **Challenges**:
  - Overfitting on small datasets.
  - Catastrophic forgetting of general knowledge.

### 3. Alignment with Human Preferences
- **Goal**: Make the model helpful, safe, and aligned with human values.
- **Techniques**:
  - **RLHF**: Use reinforcement learning with a reward model trained on human feedback.
  - **DPO**: Optimize directly on preference data without a reward model.
- **How It Works**:
  - Collect human feedback (e.g., pairwise preferences: "Response A is better than Response B").
  - Train a reward model (RLHF) or optimize directly (DPO).
  - Fine-tune the LLM using the reward signal.

## Practical Implementation
You’ll implement RLHF and DPO in this section. The code is located in `src/section_2_training/`:
- `rlhf.py`: Contains the RLHF training loop.
  - **Code Placeholder**: Implement the reward model and PPO optimization loop.
- `dpo.py`: Contains the DPO training loop.
  - **Code Placeholder**: Implement the preference-based optimization loop.

### Project 2: Aligning with RLHF and DPO
- **Goal**: Align a pretrained LLM using RLHF and DPO.
- **Steps**:
  1. Prepare a dataset with human preference pairs.
  2. Implement RLHF in `rlhf.py`.
  3. Implement DPO in `dpo.py`.
  4. Compare the aligned models on a dialogue task.
- **Details**: See [Project 2: Aligning with RLHF and DPO](project_2_alignment.md).
