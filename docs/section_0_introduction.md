# Section 0: Introduction to Building Large Language Models from Scratch

Large Language Models (LLMs) power applications like chatbots and text generation. Building production-ready LLMs requires understanding their architecture, training, deployment, and ethical considerations. This guide provides a step-by-step approach with practical projects.

Welcome to the "Build Your Own Large Language Models From Scratch" repository! This guide is designed to take you on a comprehensive journey through the process of creating, training, fine-tuning, deploying, and applying Large Language Models (LLMs) for real-world use. Whether you're an intermediate machine learning engineer looking to deepen your skills or an advanced practitioner aiming to build production-ready systems, this repository offers a structured path with theoretical insights, practical implementations, and hands-on projects.

## What This Repository Offers
This repository combines:
- **Theoretical Foundations**: Detailed explanations of the underlying concepts, from the Transformer architecture to advanced training techniques.
- **Practical Implementations**: Step-by-step code in PyTorch to build and experiment with LLMs.
- **Hands-On Projects**: Real-world exercises to solidify your understanding, ranging from implementing a Transformer to deploying a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) application.

By the end of this guide, you’ll have the knowledge and tools to design, train, and deploy your own LLMs tailored to specific tasks.

## Target Audience
This repository is tailored for:
- **Intermediate to Advanced Machine Learning Engineers** who are comfortable with:
  - Programming in **Python** and using **PyTorch**.
  - Mathematical concepts such as **linear algebra**, **probability**, and **neural networks**.
  - Fundamental machine learning concepts, including **supervised learning**, **optimization**, and basic neural network architectures.
- **Prerequisites**: Familiarity with these topics will help you follow along. If you're new to some areas, don’t worry—each section includes explanations to bridge the gap.

## Learning Path
The guide is divided into eight sections, each accompanied by a project to apply the concepts:
1. **Introduction**: Overview of LLMs and the tools you’ll use.
2. **The Transformer Architecture**: Dive into the core of modern LLMs and implement it.
3. **Training LLMs to Follow Instructions**: Explore pretraining, fine-tuning, and alignment techniques.
4. **Scaling Model Training**: Learn to scale training with distributed systems.
5. **Fine-Tuning LLMs**: Master efficient fine-tuning methods like LoRA and QLoRA.
6. **Deploying LLMs**: Build scalable and secure deployment pipelines.
7. **Building the Application Layer**: Create practical applications with RAG.
8. **Ethical Considerations and Safety**: Address bias, fairness, and safety in LLMs.
9. **Capstone Project**: Integrate your skills into a complete LLM application.

## Tools and Technologies
You’ll work with a modern stack of libraries and frameworks, including:
- **PyTorch**: Core framework for building and training neural networks.
- **Transformers**: For leveraging pre-built Transformer models and utilities.
- **TRL**: For reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF).
- **PEFT**: For parameter-efficient fine-tuning (e.g., LoRA).
- **Accelerate**: For distributed training optimization.
- **vLLM**: For efficient inference and deployment.
- **FastAPI**: For building application endpoints.
- **FAISS and Sentence-Transformers**: For RAG and embedding generation.
- **Matplotlib**: For visualizing training progress.
- **Hugging Face**: Transformers, TRL, PEFT, Accelerate.
