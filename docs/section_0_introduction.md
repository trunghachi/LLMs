# Section 0: Introduction

This section introduces the guide, outlining its goals, audience, and tools.

## Overview
Large Language Models (LLMs) power applications like chatbots and text generation. Building production-ready LLMs requires understanding their architecture, training, deployment, and ethical considerations. This guide provides a step-by-step approach with practical projects.

## Target Audience
- Intermediate to advanced ML engineers.
- Familiarity with Python, PyTorch, linear algebra, and neural networks.
- Optional: Experience with AWS or cloud platforms.

## Tools
- **PyTorch**: Core framework.
- **Hugging Face**: Transformers, TRL, PEFT, Accelerate.
- **vLLM**: Deployment.
- **FastAPI**: APIs.
- **AWS SageMaker**: Distributed training.

## Structure
The guide includes:
1. [The Transformer Architecture](section_1_transformer.md)
2. [Training LLMs](section_2_training.md)
3. [Scaling Training](section_3_scaling.md)
4. [Fine-Tuning](section_4_finetuning.md)
5. [Deployment](section_5_deployment.md)
6. [Applications](section_6_application.md)
7. [Ethics](section_7_ethics.md)
8. [Capstone](section_8_capstone.md)

Each section has a project to apply concepts.
