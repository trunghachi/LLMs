# Section 7: Ethical Considerations and Safety

Large Language Models (LLMs) can have significant societal impacts, raising concerns about bias, fairness, and safety. This section explores these issues and provides strategies to mitigate risks, ensuring responsible LLM development and deployment.

## Objectives
- Understand ethical challenges in LLM development.
- Learn techniques to improve fairness and safety.
- Prepare for Project 7, where you’ll build a content filter.

## Ethical Challenges
- **Bias**: LLMs can perpetuate biases in training data (e.g., gender, racial biases).
- **Misinformation**: Risk of generating false or harmful content.
- **Privacy**: Potential to leak sensitive information from training data.

## Mitigation Strategies
- **Bias Mitigation**: Use debiasing techniques or fairness-aware training.
- **Content Filtering**: Implement filters to detect and block harmful outputs.
- **Transparency**: Document training data and model limitations.

## Safety
Content filters for harmful outputs.

## Responsible Deployment
Follow NIST AI Risk Management Framework.

## Practical Implementation
You’ll implement a content filter to detect harmful outputs. The code is located in `src/section_7_ethics/`:
- `content_filter.py`: Contains the content filtering logic.
  - **Code Placeholder**: Implement a toxicity detection model using a pretrained classifier.

### Project 7: Content Filter
- **Goal**: Build a content filter to detect and block harmful LLM outputs.
- **Steps**:
  1. Train a toxicity classifier on a labeled dataset.
  2. Integrate the classifier into an LLM pipeline in `content_filter.py`.
  3. Test the filter on sample outputs.
- **Details**: See [Project 7: Content Filter](project_7_content_filter.md).

## Next Steps
Proceed to [Section 8: Capstone Project](section_8_capstone.md) to integrate your skills into a complete application.
