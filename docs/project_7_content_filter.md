# Project 7: Content Filter

This project focuses on building a content filter to detect and block harmful outputs from a Large Language Model (LLM), ensuring safe and responsible usage.

## Objectives
- Build a toxicity classifier for LLM outputs.
- Integrate the classifier into an LLM pipeline.

## Steps
1. **Train a Toxicity Classifier**:
   - Use a labeled dataset (e.g., toxicity dataset).
   - Train a classifier (e.g., using a pretrained BERT model).
   - **Code Placeholder**: Implement classifier training in `content_filter.py`.
2. **Integrate into LLM Pipeline**:
   - Filter LLM outputs before returning them to the user.
   - **Code Placeholder**: Add filtering logic in `content_filter.py`.
3. **Test the Filter**:
   - Generate sample outputs and check if harmful content is blocked.

## Run
```bash
python src/section_7_ethics/content_filter.py
```

## Expected Output
- A working content filter integrated with an LLM.
- Test results showing blocked harmful outputs.

## Next Steps
Proceed to [Section 8: Capstone Project](section_8_capstone.md).
