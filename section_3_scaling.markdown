# Section 3: Scaling Model Training

Scale LLM training with distributed systems and hardware.

## Hardware
- CPU vs. GPU vs. TPU.
- GPU architecture (e.g., NVIDIA A100).

## Distributed Training
- Data parallelism (PyTorch DDP).
- Model parallelism.
- Zero Redundancy Optimizer (ZeRO).

## Optimizations
- Mixed precision (FP16/BF16).
- Fault tolerance (checkpointing).
- Cost optimization (AWS spot instances).

## Implementation
Use Hugging Face Accelerate on AWS SageMaker.
