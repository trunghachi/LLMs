# Section 5: Deploying LLMs

Deploy LLMs for scalable and secure inference.

## Strategies
- Cloud (AWS, GCP) vs. on-premises.

## Optimizations
- Continuous batching.
- KV-caching.
- Multi-LoRA.

## Security
- Input sanitization.
- Rate limiting.

## Monitoring
Prometheus/Grafana for latency and errors.

## Implementation
Use vLLM with FastAPI.

## Project
See [Project 5: LLM Endpoint with vLLM](project_5_deployment.md).
